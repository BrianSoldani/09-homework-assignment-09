# Unit 09 Node.js and ES6+ Homework: Good README Generator

## Description

My task was to create a command-line application that would allow a user to get started on it quickly and easily. The automatic and dynamic generation of a project README file would allow a project creator to spend more time working on finishing the project and less time creating a good README. The final application will need to be invoked with the following command: **node index.js**<br>

Javascript, Node.js, and ES6 were the primary technologies used for this application.<br>

### Project Details

There were several requirements for this assignment to meet minimum viability. Here are the items specifically required as well as the additional items I've included in my application:

- Command-lines that ask questions or give list choices to the user and accept user input.
- Prompts that capture user information such as GitHub username and email address.
- Additional prompts that capture items specific to the project, such as: Title, Description, Installation, Usage, Licenses, Contributing, and any Tests needed.
- Answers are stored and a functioning Table of Contents is generated for the readme file.
- The license selection displays a related badge at the top of the readme as well as mentions in the License section.
- The Questions section is populated with contact details for the user with links to GitHub profile page and email.
- Application asks for the deployed URL of the project as well as an image path to a screenshot of the project.
- Sample README file generated from the application can be found here: https://github.com/BrianSoldani/09-homework-assignment-09/blob/master/Develop/README.md


### Results

The final application performs as expected and meets the requirements given above. I've even included additional features for the final deployed URL of the application and the ability to submit an image for the deployed application. The user is given several default answers to help them build and include important pieces of the Readme file. Please view the video walkthrough below.
